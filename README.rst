Language Runtimes website
#########################

This website uses the `Pelican <http://getpelican.com/>`_ static site
generator.

To build this repository, install Pelican. I do this with ``virtualenv``
and have included a ``requirements.txt`` with the packages that I've
installed.

The Pygments theme is generated by::

    pygmentize -f html -a ".highlight pre" -S tango
